# Restaurant JavaScript Project

### About
Project created to practice the use of modules and manipulation of DOM objects.

### Install
`npm install` to install all dependencies

### Modifying
`npx webpack --watch` to keep track of all files, so no need to run `npx webpack` after each change
access `/src` folder to make changes only in `index.js` for any update to the website
